# DDPG-DIPC
This repository contains the code used for the project of the course AE4350 Bio-inspired Intelligence and Learning for Aerospace Applications.
The report is included in the repository, see the .pdf file.

The code consists of two main scripts:

DDPG_DIPC_Training.m     
      Used to train agent
      
DDPG_DIPC_Simulation.m
      Used to simulate results using trained agent
      
Additionally, the "DIPC.m"  file is used to create the learning environment.
Two videos are included as well. In the report a description for these videos is provided.
